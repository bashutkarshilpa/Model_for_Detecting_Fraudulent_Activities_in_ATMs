# ATM Fraud Detection Model

## Overview
This project aims to enhance security measures within Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) by implementing a robust system for detecting fraudulent activities. Through meticulous preprocessing, comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the strategic application of various machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost, our primary objective is to achieve heightened accuracy in identifying fraudulent transactions.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following main components:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: This section involves cleaning and transforming the raw transaction data to prepare it for analysis.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In this phase, we delve into the dataset to gain insights into the underlying patterns and characteristics of legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
   
3. **Machine Learning Models**: We employ logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost algorithms to construct a sophisticated fraud detection model.
   
4. **Evaluation**: We assess the performance of our model using various evaluation metrics to measure its accuracy in detecting fraudulent activities.

## Results
Our model achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 99.94% in identifying fraudulent activities, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing ATM security.
